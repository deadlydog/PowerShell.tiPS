    "TipText": "The Add-Member cmdlet can be used to add custom properties and methods to an object, whether it is a .NET object or PowerShell object. This can be useful when you want to add additional information to an object, or when you want to add a method to an object to perform some action.\n\nThe `Add-Member` cmdlet has a `-MemberType` parameter that can be used to specify the type of member to add. The most common types are `NoteProperty` and `ScriptMethod`. The `NoteProperty` type is used to add a new property to an object, while the `ScriptMethod` type is used to add a method to an object.\n\nThe main difference between a calculated property and adding a property to an object with Add-Member is that calculated properties are added to a new output object, while Add-Member modifies the original object.",
    "Example": "# Add a new 'Status' property, 'Size' alias, and 'SizeInMB' method to the FileInfo object.\n> $A = Get-ChildItem c:\\ps-test\\test.txt\n> $A | Add-Member -NotePropertyName Status -NotePropertyValue InProgress\n> $A.Status\nInProgress\n\n> $A | Add-Member -MemberType AliasProperty -Name Size -Value Length\n> $A.Size\n93681943\n\n> $method = {[math]::Round(($this.Length / 1MB), 2)}\n> $A | Add-Member -MemberType ScriptMethod -Name \"SizeInMB\" -Value $method\n> $A.SizeInMB()\n89.34\n\n> $A.Status = 'Complete'\n> $A.Status\nComplete",

This is the default.\n- `SilentlyContinue`: Suppress the error message (so it is not written to the error stream) and continue executing the script.\n- `Ignore`: Suppress the error message and continue executing the script. Unlike SilentlyContinue, Ignore doesn't add the error message to the $Error automatic variable.\n- `Inquire`: Display the error message and prompt the user to continue or stop executing the script.\n- `Break`: Display the error message and enter the debugger. Also breaks into the debugger when a terminating error occurs.\n\nYou can set the global behavior for the current scope by setting the `$ErrorActionPreference` variable.

Similarly, if you have Strict Mode enabled and try to access a property of a null object (e.g. $nullObject.SomeProperty), an exception will be thrown. The null-conditional operators allow you to avoid these exceptions and return null instead. You can even chain these together when accessing nested properties.\n\nOne slight caveat is that because '?' can be part of a variable name, you must use braces '{}' around the variable name. e.g. ${someVariable}?.Property or ${someVariable}?[0].",

This cmdlet can be used to calculate the sum, average, minimum, maximum, and count of numeric properties in objects. When used with text input, it can count characters, words, and lines.\n\nThe cmdlet returns an object containing properties for each statistic, but the statistic is only actually calculated if you provided the switch for it.

This ensures that the correct path separator is used for the current platform (e.g. `\\` on Windows and `/` on Linux/macOS). PowerShell 6 introduced the -AdditionalChildPath parameter, which allows you to specify multiple child paths to join.\n\nSimilarly, you can use the `Split-Path` cmdlet to split a path into its components. This is useful for extracting the directory or file name from a full path.",
